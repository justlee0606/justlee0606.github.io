I am a second year student studying **computer science** at UC San Diego. I am interested in backend development, robotics, and mobile app development. ~~I also enjoy grinding leetcode.~~

My favorite quote from Denzel Washington in *The Equalizer*:
>When you pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too.
